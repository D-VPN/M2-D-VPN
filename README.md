# <i>Team Name:</i> D-VPN
## <i>Problem Code:</i> M2
## <i>Problem Statement:</i>
Build a model to recognize the hand sign-language of deaf and dumb. Live video through mobile/web-cam should recognize the sign language in real time.
## <i>Reason / Motivation:</i>
<p>Right now, in teh world there are more than 38 crore people who are deaf & dumb (we'll address them as specially abled). These people often find themselves amidst a sea
of loneliness as people often tend to ignore communication with them since their <b>Sign Language</b> is difficult to grasp.</p>

<p>Also, there are no such app present in the market, that help in, <i>recognising the sign language gestures at real time and translate them for a common user</i>, so that he/she
can understand a specially abled and also befriend them.</p>

## <i>Solution?</i>
<p> <b><i>Team D-VPN</i></b> brings to you <b><i><em>Gesture Talk</em></i></b> - an app that promises to be user-friendly and work on Machine Learning in order to decode for 
the normal user at real-time, what the specially abled is trying to convey through his/her hand gestures via the sign language.</p>

<p>With an attractive and user-friendly UI of the Native app that our Machine Learning Model will be incorporated into, we plan to bring everyone closer. Regardless of their
ability and way of communication. The <i>Market Validation</i> for such a product is very high, as no solutions other than to learn the Sign Language from scratch exists.

## Features of Model & App:
<ol>
  <li> Attractive & User-friendly UI </li>
  <li> Model Predicts the Entire Sign-Language Alphabet</li>
  <li> Real-time translation into words/letters</li>
  <li> Voice assistant enabled </li>
  <li> Model trained over almost 90,000 images collectively </li>
</ol>
